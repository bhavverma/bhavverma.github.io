Abstract: Here, we introduce HiTaxon, an end-to-end hierarchical ensemble framework for taxonomic classification. HiTaxon facilitates data collection and processing, reference database construction and optional training of ML models to streamline ensemble creation. We show that databases created by HiTaxon improve the species-level performance of reference-dependent classifiers, while reducing their computational overhead. In addition, through exploring hierarchical methods for HiTaxon, we highlight that our custom approach to hierarchical ensembling improves species-level classification relative to traditional strategies. Finally, we demonstrate the improved performance of our hierarchical ensembles over current state-of-the-art classifiers in species classification using datasets comprised of either simulated or experimentally derived reads.
