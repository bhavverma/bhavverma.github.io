I am a PhD student at the University of Toronto. My research interests pertain to the development and application of machine learning algorithms to improve clinical health outcomes. Previously, I completed my BSc at York University where I helped develop [TetraMANIA]("https://tetramania.bradley.edu/"), a tool to predict novel members of Tetrahymena Thermophila complexes. I also completed an MSc at the University of Toronto which focused on improving the performance of computational tools in determining the taxonomic identity of short-reads derived from metagenomic datasets; leading to the development of [HiTaxon]("https://github.com/ParkinsonLab/HiTaxon")
